# WeatherBot — Potential Improvements

Brutal backlog of upgrades. Don't forget these just because paper PnL looked cute for a week.

## Critical (fix or stay regarded)

### 1. Probability model — don't "fix" it with a naive continuous CDF

**Status:** Done (2026-07-17) — Option B partition model shipped.

**What the code does today:** `bucket_prob` uses Gaussian residual mass over `resolution_bin` (half-degree edges for exact °F, expanded ranges, consistent tails). Bias applied as μ = forecast − bias. Only the **forecast-matched** bucket is still tradable. Full formulas: **`MODEL.md`**.

**Still open under §1:**

- [ ] EV-shop non-matched buckets across the event partition
- [ ] Horizon-dependent σ (see §2)

Historical traps (still valid as design notes):

#### Trap A — zero-width buckets

`"be 80°F"` parses as `(t_low, t_high) = (80, 80)`.

Naive continuous interval prob:

```text
p = Φ((t_high - μ) / σ) - Φ((t_low - μ) / σ)
```

with equal bounds is **always 0**. A bot that "fixed" binary this way would never trade exact-temp markets. Resolution is discrete (rounded degrees); point buckets need **positive-measure bins** (e.g. half-unit: `[v-0.5, v+0.5)`), not a continuous integral over a point.

#### Trap B — default σ=2 vs Polymarket mode prices

Even with a proper 1° window, a normal with default `SIGMA_F = 2.0` puts only ~**20%** mass in the peak bin:

```text
2·Φ(0.5/2) - 1 ≈ 0.197
```

Polymarket often prices the favorite bucket around **30–45¢**. Then:

```text
EV ≈ p/price - 1 = 0.197/0.35 - 1 ≈ -0.44
```

A "statistically pure" bot with uncalibrated σ=2 would conclude **every middle bucket is massively overpriced**, refuse standard mode trades, and only touch tails (`or higher` / `or below`) or absurdly cheap bins. That is a full strategy flip — not a free bugfix.

| Model | Implicit claim | Behavior |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Binary `p∈{0,1}` | Point-forecast match = certainty | Buys 30–45¢ favorites hard; max bet |
| Normal σ=2 on 1° bins | Residual error ~2°F Gaussian | Hates those favorites; mostly idle on middles |
| Market ~35¢ on mode | ~σ≈1.1 if Gaussian | Between the two extremes |

Binary is **max overconfidence**. Naive continuous with default σ is **structural underconfidence vs how these books are priced** (or correctly skeptical only *if* true residual error really is ~2°F).

#### What was implemented (Option B)

- [x] Resolution-aware bins via `resolution_bin` (exact → half-unit; ranges → `[a-0.5, b+0.5)`; tails half-lines)
- [x] Continuous `bucket_prob` for all bucket types; `event_bucket_probs` for full-event tests
- [x] Calibrated σ + bias at entry (`get_sigma` / `get_bias`)
- [x] Keep match filter (forecast-matched only); EV/Kelly use real `p`
- [x] `min_ev` lowered to `0.05` so tight-σ modes can trade; uncalibrated 1° favorites at 35¢ still skip

**Do not** regress to continuous CDF over raw equal bounds (Trap A) or expect binary-era fill rates under default σ=2 (Trap B).

### 2. Make calibration actually work (this is the real math core)

**Status:** Partial (2026-07-16)

**Done:**

- [x] Call `get_actual_temp` on Polymarket resolve; store `actual_temp`
- [x] Backfill actuals for past market dates (early exits still learn residuals)
- [x] Backfill Polymarket `resolved_outcome` for early-exited positions (counterfactual bucket win/loss; no double bankroll credit; stores `hold_to_resolution_pnl`)
- [x] `run_calibration` accepts `status == "resolved"` **or** `resolved` flag
- [x] Read production snapshot shape (`ecmwf` / `hrrr` / `metar` keys) via `snapshot_source_temp`
- [x] Track **bias** (mean signed error) alongside MAE→sigma
- [x] Characterization tests updated (`tests/test_calibration.py`)

**Still open:**

- [ ] Lower `calibration_min` once quality data exists (or hierarchical defaults earlier)
- [x] Apply calibrated σ **and bias** to every probability estimate (partition model — 2026-07-17)
- [ ] Separate calibration by horizon (D+0 vs D+1 vs D+2)
- [x] Report model-implied mode mass vs market mode price (`status` / `report` — 2026-07-17)
- [ ] Optional: use RMSE (or MAE→Gaussian conversion) as σ scale instead of raw MAE

### 3. Portfolio / correlation risk

**Status:** Partial (2026-07-16) — hard caps shipped; correlation haircut not yet.

**Done** (`config.json` + open path `[RISK]` skips):

- [x] Max open positions total — `max_open_positions` (default 20)
- [x] Max open per city — `max_open_per_city` (default 2)
- [x] Max open per date — `max_open_per_date` (default 6)
- [x] Max total capital at risk (% of equity = cash + open costs) — `max_capital_at_risk_pct` (default 0.2)
- [x] Unit tests — `tests/test_portfolio_risk.py`

**Still open:**

- [ ] Correlation haircut when multiple cities share the same weather regime

## High ROI (degen upgrades that actually print or stop bleed)

### 4. Source blending, not single "best source"

Don't just pick HRRR or ECMWF. Blend them with learned weights.

Example:

- US D+0/D+1: heavier HRRR/METAR
- EU/Asia: heavier ECMWF
- Late horizon: decay confidence harder

Blending only pays after residuals are honest; otherwise you're averaging garbage into μ.

### 5. Better entry filters

Current filters are fine but incomplete.

**Add:**

- Min liquidity / depth at ask (not just volume)
- Skip if orderbook is thin / fake mid
- Avoid ultra-narrow buckets when forecast uncertainty > bucket width (only meaningful once σ is real)
- Don't enter if market already heavily repriced toward your forecast
- Note: scan path still treats `outcomePrices` like bid/ask; real bid/ask is only re-fetched at entry — thin-book risk is real

### 6. Resolution source audit

Polymarket resolves on specific stations/sources. Your bot assumes airport stations + Visual Crossing for actuals (and Polymarket close for win/loss).

**Add:**

- Log official resolution criteria per market
- Compare assumed station vs actual resolution source
- Flag mismatches before they heem you
- This also defines the correct discrete binning for item 1

### 7. Fees / slippage realism

Paper fills at ask are fantasy.

**Add:**

- Assume worse fill than mid/ask
- Model taker fees if/when live
- Track theoretical vs realistic PnL separately

---

## Live Trading (only after paper proof)

### 8. Don't go live on vibes

Require before real money:

- 50+ resolved trades minimum
- Win rate + EV by city/source/horizon
- Stop-loss and forecast-change exits reviewed
- No giant unrealized mark-to-market cope

### 9. Live trading via official Polymarket `py-sdk`

Current weatherbot is **paper only** and talks to Gamma via plain `requests` — there is **no** `py-clob-client` dependency to remove. When going live, use the official stack:

- Repo: https://github.com/Polymarket/py-sdk
- Auth, markets, orderbook, order placement

**Needs:**

- Add `py-sdk` for live path (keep paper path on requests if useful)
- Wallet / API key handling via env (not hardcoded)
- Order placement + cancel logic
- Partial fill handling
- Position reconciliation vs Polymarket state
- Kill switch

### 10. Secrets hygiene

**Done (2026-07-15):** `VC_KEY` moved to `.env`. `config.json` is strategy params only.
`.env` is gitignored. Use `.env.example` as the template.

## Data / Learning upgrades

### 11. Richer self-learning

Beyond sigma MAE:

- City win rate
- Source win rate
- Bucket-width performance
- Time-of-day / lead-time performance
- Auto-downweight cities that suck
- Model-vs-market calibration plots (mode mass vs favorite price)

### 12. Forecast change exits are crude

Current logic closes if forecast drifts far from entry bucket.

**Improve:**

- Recompute live EV; only exit if EV flipped negative (requires a real `p` model)
- Don't panic-close on tiny model noise
- Separate "model flip" vs "price dump" exits

### 13. Store more signal, less vibes

Already saves market JSON. Expand:

- Full orderbook snapshot at entry
- Competing bucket prices (full event book)
- Which source would have won ex-post
- Post-resolution attribution report

---

## Ops / Quality of life

### 14. CLI that matches reality

**Status:** Partial — entrypoint is `weatherbet.py`; dry-run `scan` shipped.

**Add:**

- [x] `python weatherbet.py scan` — dry-run preview (markets found + would-be trades; no fills/writes)
- [x] Consistent naming (`weatherbet.py`)
- [ ] Better logging levels

### 15. Monitoring

Background process is fine, but:

- Heartbeat / last-scan timestamp
- Alert on repeated API failures
- Daily report of resolved PnL only (ignore open mark noise)

### 16. Config defaults sanity check

Current-ish defaults:

- `min_ev: 0.05` (was 0.1 under binary p)
- `max_price: 0.45`
- `max_bet: 20`
- `kelly_fraction: 0.25`
- `SIGMA_F: 2.0` / `SIGMA_C: 1.2` (code constants)
- `max_open_positions: 20` / `max_open_per_city: 2` / `max_open_per_date: 6` / `max_capital_at_risk_pct: 0.2`

If you move to probabilistic `p`:

- Re-tune hard — mode mass may be ~20–40%, not 1.0; sizing and EV gates change completely
- Do **not** keep `min_ev` / Kelly settings that only made sense under binary certainty
- If you stay match-style, drop or relabel fake EV/Kelly and size with explicit caps

## Priority order (if we actually ship upgrades)

1. ~~**Decide strategy honesty:** probabilistic book vs match-style filter~~ **Done — Option B partition + match filter (2026-07-17)**
2. ~~Wire resolution actuals + residual calibration plumbing~~ **Done — actuals + σ/bias applied at entry**
3. ~~**If probabilistic:** resolution-aware bins~~ **Done**; full-event EV shopping still open
4. ~~Portfolio caps / risk limits~~ **Partial — hard caps done; correlation haircut open**
5. Source blending after residuals are real
6. Resolution source audit (defines bins + avoids station heems)
7. Paper → live via `py-sdk` only after resolved track record
8. Horizon-split σ; mode-mass vs market report

---

## Don't do

- Live YOLO before resolved sample size
- Trust unrealized PnL on open weather marks
- Add 20 cities before the math works on the current 20
- "AI rewrite the whole bot" without deciding the probability product
- **Naive continuous CDF on raw `[t_low, t_high]`** — bricks zero-width buckets (`p=0`)
- **Uncalibrated σ=2 continuous "fix"** — systematically refuses 30–45¢ mode buckets; full strategy flip by accident
- Pretend Kelly is risk management while `p=1` on every match

---

## Notes from first run (2026-07-15)

- Paper bot opened ~13 positions quickly
- Many buys at max bet because `p≈1` under current math
- VC key works
- Continuous mode runs via `python weatherbet.py run`
- Self-learning exists in name only until actuals + residual wiring work

## Notes from review (2026-07-16)

- Binary `p` is max overconfidence, not a clever discrete model
- Continuous CDF without discrete bins is wrong for exact-temp markets
- Continuous with default σ=2 fights typical Polymarket favorite prices (~30–45¢ vs ~20% model mass)
- Market-implied σ for mode bins is closer to ~1.1°F if Gaussian — calibrate, don't assume 2.0
- Repo has no `py-clob-client`; live path is greenfield `py-sdk` + env secrets
- Characterization test suite added (`pytest` — see `TESTING_PLAN.md`)

## Shipped (2026-07-16)

- Characterization tests for math/parse/storage/calibration baseline
- Portfolio hard caps (total / city / date / capital %)
- Resolve + backfill station `actual_temp`; calibration reads production snaps; stores bias
- Early-exit markets: Polymarket `resolved_outcome` + `hold_to_resolution_pnl` (annotate only; bankroll unchanged)

## Shipped (2026-07-17)

- Option B: `resolution_bin` + continuous partition `bucket_prob`; bias at entry
- `event_bucket_probs` helper; tests rewritten for partition semantics
- `min_ev` default `0.05` (was `0.1`) for non-dead paper under realistic `p`
- Docs: `MODEL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, this file
- Model-vs-market report on `status` / `report` (recompute partition p vs stored mids; EV pass counts; cal summary)

If future-you is reading this: partition `p` is live; next leverage is horizon calibration and whether to shop non-matched bins. Don't regress to raw equal-bound CDF.
